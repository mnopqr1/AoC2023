# AoC2023
my work on advent of code in 2023

## Day 1
Harder than I expected / remembered from last year.

Probably also because I thought I'd try C++ and I don't really know it...

## Day 2
Easier than yesterday, I thought, although I had no idea how to parse the input in C++.

Instead of trying to figure it out directly, I first wrote the code in Python
and then asked Copilot to help me translate it in C++. Is that a good way to
learn?
